## Hegde’s Progress

- Implemented chronological feed for posts
- Added ssg flag and frontmatter field to allow working with draft posts. Changed page rendering process to prevent rendering of unnecessary posts.

- Fixed iframe, video and image rendering (CSS)

## Whats Next (Anirudh and Hegde):

- Rebuild the project from ground up and split up the rendering process and Generator struct
- Follow a TDD-based approach during the rebuild
